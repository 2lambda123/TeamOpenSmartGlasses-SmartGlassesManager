mediapipe issues - wrong timestamp
    -move mediapipe interface to background service so the timestamp is never lost
        -yes, could be solved by fixing the class to persist timestamp, but no point because we are moving to a service anyway for other reasons
        
mobile communication - can't connect without wifi
    -try to run network extension app and proxy on vuzix blade to connect vuzix directly to mobile compute
    -use Onplus7T hotspot and find IP on wearnet
        -code right now is asking WIFI for our IP address - need to figure out what it is on local hotspot (maybe there is a function in android to get IP address regardless of source)
    -use S7 as router
    -only demo at home for now

mobile compute can't run without application window open
    -switch to always on background service
    
Vuzix battery issues - one hour battery not long enough
    -wear 100Wh battery pack connected through shirt to vuzix
        -should run for multiple days
    -fix the battery draining software
        - switch from single camaera snapshot to video
            -grab intermittent frames and send with current socket system
            -if possible, also record video at 1080p 24fps on the device
            -test speed of transer - maybe send at 720p/640/480/less than original to mobile compute
